# EventNotify

## Synopsis

This is a Facebook Messenger chatbot intended for group chats that supports creating small, impromptu events. Once an event is created with EventNotify, the participants will receive reminders through Messenger private messages.

## Usage

To use this bot with your Messenger group, you must add the bot’s Facebook profile as a friend: <TODO: insert link here>
Then simply add the bot to your group chat. To ensure your friends get event notifications properly, they should add the bot as a friend as well.


To invoke the bot, use the prefix “EventNotify” followed by your event and participants. If no participants are specified, all members of the group chat will be auto-added.
Examples:
```
“EventNotify Invite @aakash @sai to hackathon Sunday 7pm at my place”
“EventNotify Basketball in Warren at 8 pm”
TODO: Add more examples
```
